## Introduction

As per Subsidiary Legislation 549.82 Infrastructure for Spatial Planning Regulations, as of 2021 the Planning Authority (PA) has assumed the role of the competent authority with regards to the INSPIRE Directive. The Directive sets the minimum conditions for interoperable sharing and exchange of spatial data across Europe as part of a larger European Interoperability Framework and the e-Government Action Plan that contributes to the Digital Single Market Agenda. Article 21 of [INSPIRE Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2007/2/oj) defines the basic principles for monitoring and reporting. More detailed implementing rules regarding INSPIRE monitoring and reporting have been adopted as [Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/1372] (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2019/1372/oj) on the 19th August 2019.
This country fiche highlights the progress in the various areas of INSPIRE implementation. It includes information on [monitoring 2024] (https://inspire-geoportal.ec.europa.eu/mr/mr2024.html) acquired in December 2024 and Member States update.


## State of Play

A high-level view on the governance, use and impact of the INSPIRE Directive in Malta. More detailed information is available on the [INSPIRE knowledge base] (http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/).

#### Coordination Structure & Progress: 

##### Coordination structure

##### Progress

•	The PA co-ordinates the implementation of the SDI (Spatial Data Infrastructure) programme. The Technical Governance Advisory group provides advisory services to the INSPIRE Team. The INSPIRE Team, which falls within the PA, is a multi-disciplinary team that provides the resources for the programme. The INSPIRE Team also has the main co-ordination function of the INSPIRE Group. The INSPIRE Group is a multi-disciplinary group which is made up of representatives from various entities including public authorities (data owners and data providers) and data consumers.

•	Through the well-established structures and co-ordination of related initiatives, Malta has managed to achieve significant progress in the implementation of the INSPIRE Directive.


### Functioning and coordination of the infrastructure <a name="functioning"></a>

•	The Malta Spatial Data Infrastructure (MSDI), found at (https://msdi.data.gov.mt), is a portal that shares geospatial information through graphical user interface and web services to the general public, public service and public sector organisations.

•	The backend storage system for the SDI was updated at the end of 2023 to the cloud-based system HaleConnect. 

•	We are currently revamping front-end system both for the website and the search catalogue. We intend to launch by Q4 2025.

•	Further improvements were seen in data sharing, access (WFS and WMS) and data/service compliance when compared to previous analysis, notwithstanding the spatial data infrastructure is continually being updated, in the light of changing schemas driven by the Commission and the challenges encountered to gather and publish relevant geospatial data. 

•	Public authorities who contribute spatial data to the MSDI portal were provided with online training on the harmonisation of datasets using Hale and the use of the INSPIRE validator.

•	Information dissemination regarding the INSPIRE Directive and data sharing updates are continuously performed through various communication channels to public authorities. An annual conference on INSPIRE Directive and the latest challenges has been held in 2023 and 2024.

•	Connection of the MSDI to the EC INSPIRE geoportal is continually ensured, and access to the infrastructure, datasets and metadata is available through the EC geoportal. 


### Usage of the infrastructure for spatial information <a name="usage"></a>

The use of the INSPIRE infrastructure and its corresponding datasets, enabled Malta to obtain a clear picture of its available spatial data and identify gaps to ensure a complete spatial infrastructure. It has also brought together a network of data providers with the aim of streamlining spatial requirements in the creation of new data. This can be seen from the diversified and continuous requests for personal use and requests from the industrial and academic sector.

### Data Sharing Arrangements <a name="data"></a>

•	In order to have a common approach to data sharing agreements, a set of [data sharing guidelines] (https://msdi.data.gov.mt/data/PMD-GDL-INSPIRE DataSharingGuidelines-v1.0.pdf) have been referred to all government entities which serves as a common guide when creating agreements for data sharing. The guidelines are based on the [“INSPIRE Guidelines on the Regulation on access”] (https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/documents/Data_and_Service_Sharing/INSPIRE_DSS_Guidance _document_final.pdf), and the [“INSPIRE – Good practice in data and service sharing”](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/data-and-service-sharing/62). Furthermore, the initiatives to transpose the guidelines into Government policy have been concluded.

•	In view of HVD Implementation, the PA is holding discussions with the competent authority for HVD with the scope of ensuring access to INSPIRE datasets which are also HVD datasets. 

•	All the current downloadable and viewable datasets within the Malta INSPIRE Geoportal (MSDI) are available at no cost.


### Costs and Benefits <a name="costs"></a>

•	The estimated costs, covering the period from January 2023 till December 2024, consist of:  IT infrastructure costs €60 000; interoperability/compliance cost €30 000; and human resource effort costs €110 000. The effort cost is an aggregation of the efforts used for administration and upkeep of the Malta geoportal, Monitoring and Reporting, general co-ordination and support, co-ordination of horizontal measures, and outreach. The human resource effort costs exclude effort required for the INSPIRE Directive implementation by stakeholders (data owners and public authorities).

•	There are many benefits that can be derived from the implementation of the INSPIRE Directive, some of which include the relocation of spatial datasets to a central repository which facilitates data discovery, the use of common technical standards that allow interoperability amongst public authorities and member states, and the sharing and reuse of spatial data using a common infrastructure.
