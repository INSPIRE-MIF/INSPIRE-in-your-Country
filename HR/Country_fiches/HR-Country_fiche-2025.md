## Introduction

The INSPIRE Directive sets the minimum conditions for interoperable sharing and exchange of spatial data across Europe as
part of a larger European Interoperability Framework and the e-Government Action Plan that contributes to the Digital Single
Market Agenda. Article 21 of INSPIRE Directive defines the basic principles for monitoring and reporting. More detailed
implementing rules regarding INSPIRE monitoring and reporting have been adopted as Commission Implementing Decision
(EU) 2019/1372 on the 19th August 2019.
This Country Fiche highlights Croatia progress in the various areas of INSPIRE implementation. It includes information on
