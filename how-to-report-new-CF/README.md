How to report new Country fiche
===============================

To report a new Country fiche for your Member State, please follow the instructions below:

*   Fork the INSPIRE-in-your-Country repository (For more information, see "[Working with forks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks)").
*   In the forked repository, create a new Markdown _.md_ file in the folder related to your country, e.g. _/INSPIRE-in-your-Country/AT/Country\_fiches/_ (For more information, see "[Creating new files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/creating-new-files)"), with the following characteristics:
    *   the file name should follow the following naming structure "_<MS-code>-Country\_fiche-<Year>.md_", e.g. _AT-Country\_fiches-2024.md_.
    *   the document structure should follow the [country fiche template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INSPIRE-MIF/INSPIRE-in-your-Country/main/how-to-report-new-CF/Country_fiche_Template.md) (you can copy/paste the markdown syntax).
*   Edit your new country fiche and commit your changes (For more information on the use of the Markdown syntax, see "[Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)"), in particular:
    *   make sure that links are encoded using the proper syntax, i.e. _\[link text](URL)_, otherwise, they are not converted as hyperlinks by GitHub pages.
    *   to insert an image, create a folder "_images_" in your "_Country_fiches_" folder, upload the image and refer to it using the following syntax: _\!\[Image Alt Text](images/image-name.png)_
*   When finished, create a pull request to propose changes you've made to the fork of the INSPIRE-in-your-Country repository (For more information, see "[Creating a pull request from a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)").

Use the [_Issue tracker_](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/INSPIRE-in-your-Country/issues/new) to report issues with this procedure.
