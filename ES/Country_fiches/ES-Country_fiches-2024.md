## Introduction

The INSPIRE Directive sets the minimum conditions for interoperable sharing and exchange of spatial data across Europe as part of a larger European Interoperability Framework and the e-Government Action Plan that contributes to the Digital Single Market Agenda. Article 21 of INSPIRE Directive defines the basic principles for monitoring and reporting. More detailed implementing rules regarding INSPIRE monitoring and reporting have been
adopted as [Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/1372](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2019/1372/oj) on the 19th August 2019.

This country fiche highlights the progress in the various areas of INSPIRE implementation. It includes information on [monitoring 2023](https://inspire-geoportal.ec.europa.eu/catalog/views/inspireportal/monitoringreporting/site/mr2023_details.html?country=es) acquired in December 2023 and Member States update.

## State of Play

[**Spanish SDI (Infraestructura de datos Espaciales de España, IDEE)**](https://www.idee.es)

![Spanish SDI logo](https://www.idee.es/resources/presentaciones/CODIIGE/CountryFiche2020/IDEE.png)

Spain transposed INSPIRE Directive into national law since 2010, called [**LISIGE** "Law about Infrastructures and Services about Geographic information in Spain"](https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2010/07/06/pdfs/BOE-A-2010-10707.pdf), and has been implemented and maintainted the national INSPIRE nodes and regional INSPIRE nodes since then.

[**Spanish SDI geoportal**](https://www.idee.es/en/web/idee/inicio) is the access point national and regional SDI have two catalogues, tools and publishes their information thought view and download services.
- [Spanish SDI Catalogue](https://www.idee.es/csw-inspire-idee/srv/spa/catalog.search)
- [Official Catalogue of Inspire Data and Services (CODSI)](https://www.idee.es/csw-codsi-idee/srv/spa/catalog.search#/home)

The spatial data is published in the above catalogs and is classified as follows:

- **Annex I, II and III datasets** have been published and most of them are harmonized according to INSPIRE.
- **Priority datasets** referring to environmental regulations have been identified and published.
- **High value datasets** defined in Regulation (EU) 2023/138 classified as geospatial, Earth observation and environment and mobility.

All of them are published through view and download services.

#### Coordination Structure & Progress: 

##### Coordination structure

[**Geographic High Council**](https://www.transportes.gob.es/organos-colegiados/consejo-superior-geografico/csg) is the director body of the [National Cartographic System (SCN)](https://www.scne.es/), having consultation and planning role for the official geographic information and cartography. Geographic High Council is the National Contact Point for INSPIRE and the coordination and direction for the Spanish SDI.

![Spanish SDI coordination](https://www.idee.es/resources/presentaciones/CODIIGE/CountryFiche2020/CSGCODIIGE.jpg)

Geographic High Council created the **[Executive Board of the Geographic Information Infrastructure of Spain](https://www.idee.es/en/web/idee/codiige)** (CODIIGE) for managing and controlling IDEE. It takes responsibility for directing Spain's SDI, and immediately began to define the Technical WGs with the objective of analysing the application of the implementing rules of INSPIRE by the Spanish Public Administrations and helping their bodies and Organizations to achieve compliance. Furthermore, it is the body responsible for coordination and management of the SDI of Spain, owing to which it is responsible for its constitution and maintenance, being responsible for:
1. Proposing to the competent Authorities the actions to be performed by the Administrations or Organizations of the public sector for the establishment of the IDEE.
2. Guaranteeing its accessibility and interoperability.
3. Integrating the contributions of other producers or suppliers.

The [CODIIGE](https://www.idee.es/en/web/idee/codiige) deal with interinstitutional coordination the organization of Spanish SDI (IDEE) is based on 14 national and 17 regional nodes; each regional node establishes the necessary coordination with the local administration and other agents.

Depending on [**CODIIGE**](https://www.idee.es/en/web/idee/codiige):
- There are some [Thematic Working Groups (GTT)](https://www.idee.es/en/web/idee/codiige#grupostt), (one per INSPIRE Theme although some themes are grouped) with representation of all institutions with responsibility for data and/ or services under scope of INSPIRE. These Thematic Working Groups (GTT) have translated INSPIRE Technical Guidelines (Data Specifications) and have adapted to the case of Spain. These technical documents are available here.
- Identification of high-value datasets: geospatial, Earth observation and environment and movility.
- Identification of priority data through environment ministries: The [Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAPA)](https://www.mapa.gob.es) and the [Ministry for Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge (MITECO)](https://www.miteco.gob.es/es.html).
- Furthermore, there are four transversal Working Groups (Metadata and catalogue; Network services; Monitoring and reporting; Data and services policy).
- Finally, there is a Working Group for the NSDI (GTIDEE) with representatives from public and private sector and academia. GTIDEE meets 2 times a year to discuss different aspects of the standars, Technical Guidance, open data and new technologies for the implementation of INSPIRE, [Iberian Conference SDI](https://www.idee.es/en/web/idee/jiide) and to coordinate the experts work on INSPIRE.

**Spain’s recovery and resilience plan**
Procurement for the modernisation of the Spatial Data Infrastructure for Spain (IDEE) through the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan with an estimated budget of 11 052 000 € for the next 4 years (2021-2024). The contracts cover the following topics:
- Technological platform on the cloud.
- Adaptation of the IDEE to the new technological specifications such as the implementation and configuration of new network services compliant with INSPIRE Directive based on the API-OGC and development of client applications for their exploitation. (Examples of Spanish SDI OGC API [here](https://api-features.idee.es/))
- Postal address service web management system: Working on the creation of national geocoder service to publish official addresses that will be the result of the harmonization and integration of official addresses the main suppliers of information about addresses at national, regional and local government organizations. In this project involves Directorate General for Cadastre, Basque Government, Government of Navarre and another regions like Valencia, Madrid, Andalucía... All of them are supported with the Postal Codes provided by the Post Office Group, names of streets of National Statistics Institute together with the official settlements of National Geographic Institute (IGN).
- Development of a national vector tile service: Creation of [**official base map multiscale**](https://ideespain.github.io/mapabase/) from official sources national, regional and local sources. Its technology is based on vector tile services.
- Maintenance of national catalogues, validation of metadata and publication on the open data portal.

Strengthening the work carried out between the Cadastre and the Land Registry. The Spanish Law 13/2015 implements an effective coordination of transactions executed by Cadastre and the Property Rights Registry. These institutions are two separate organizations with differentiated mandates and competences, both working in the domain of land administration. The Cadastre, registries and notaries have worked together to design a technologically advanced model of institutional interaction for this coordination purpose based in the INSPIRE GML of the Cadastral Parcel and the position of the Building.

[**Navarra Territorial Information System (SITNA)**](https://geoportal.navarra.es/es/) has developed a [**Strategic Plan 2020-2023**](https://gobiernoabierto.navarra.es/es/gobernanza/planes-y-programas-accion-gobierno/plan-estrategico-del-sistema-informacion-territorial-2020-2023) manages the official geographic information for the Government of Navarra.

This catalogue is connected via harvesting or file interchange with the catalogues of national and regional SDI nodes, is the base for the monitoring process and for feeding the INSPIRE Geoportal. All INSPIRE compliant services available in Spain are available in European INSPIRE Geoportal.
  - [Spanish Registry](https://registro.idee.es/registry) based on [Re3gistry](https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/solutions/re3gistry_en/).
- Much more OGC services are available but not all are INSPIRE compliant services and SDI Navarre, SDI Catalonia and National Cartographic System services publish their spatial data via OGC APIs
- The list of key spatial data sets required for other environmental policies is already identified.
- Big effort on training, seminars, events at regional and local levels; [twitter @IDEESpain](https://twitter.com/ideespain?lang=es) with 3340 followers, electronic monthly bulletin [“SobreIDEs”](http://www.idee.es/boletin-sobre-ides) and Spanish SDI Blog ["Blog IDEE"](https://blog-idee.blogspot.com/) with an average of 150 articles per year.
  
- Thematic Working Groups (GTT), was asked to produce Guides about how to make compliant with INSPIRE the identified datasets and the already implemented view and download services. These Thematic Working Groups (GTT) have translated INSPIRE Technical Guidelines (Data Specifications) and have adapted to the case of Spain. These technical documents are available here.

**INSPIRE priority dataset**

- Identification of priority data through environment ministries: The [Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAPA)](https://www.mapa.gob.es/es/cartografia-y-sig/ide/) and the [Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge (MITECO)](https://www.miteco.gob.es/es/cartografia-y-sig/ide.html).
- The [MAPA](https://www.mapa.gob.es/es/cartografia-y-sig/ide/)and [MITECO](https://www.miteco.gob.es/es/cartografia-y-sig/ide.html) SDI Geoportal is the central access point to the INSPIRE priority data set provided for environmental reporting.

**Cadastral Parcels, Addresses and buildings**
- INSPIRE GML continuing being used as exchange format of Cadastral Parcels, Addresses and buildings in the real estate traffic in Spain by law in Spain. These themes are downloaded though ATOM Feed services of [General Directorate for Cadastre](https://www.catastro.meh.es/) , [Govern of Navarre](https://www.navarra.es/eu/hasiera) and [Basque government](https://www.euskadi.eus/gobierno-vasco/inicio/). These services allow the completed download by municipality of the INSPIRE data set
- INSPIRE ATOM feeds of Administrative Units, Cadastral Parcels, Addresses and Buildings are included in Corda from EEA and Gisco(Eurostat) and now also in EuroGeographics Open Maps for Europe.
- 2D and 3D building cadastral data are available through the OGC API Feature included in the [Geospatially Enabled Ecosystem for Europe (GeoE3)](https://geoe3.eu/) platform.

**High-Value Datasets (HVD)**

The CODIIGE monitors that INSPIRE HVDs comply with the conditions set out in the [Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/138 of laying down a list of specific high-value datasets and the arrangements for their publication and re-use](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32023R0138).

### Data Sharing Arrangements <a name="data"></a>

[**National Cartographic System (SCN)**](https://www.scne.es/)

- Existence of big projects of collaborative data production and harmonisation under the umbrella of [National Cartographic System (SCN)](https://www.scne.es/), which include sharing of resulting data; the on-going production of georeferenced reference data increased the sharing of data between public admin. The web site of SCN has a list of public bodies collaborating in the production of geographic data products each year as a result of collaboration agreements with [National Geographic Institute (IGN)](https://www.ign.es/web/ign/portal) of Spain.
 - For example: The following national and regional organisations have collaborated in the capture of the [orthoimagery](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/theme/oi): [National Geographic Institute (IGN)](https://www.ign.es/web/ign/portal), [CNIG](https://www.ign.es/web/ign/portal/qsm-cnig), [Spanish Agrarian Guarantee Fund (FEGA)](https://www.fega.gob.es/en), [General Directorate for Cadastre](https://www.catastro.meh.es/), Autonomous Communities of Aragon, Canary Islands, Catalonia, Valencian Community, Andalusia, Extremadura, Murcia, Galicia, Castile and León, Castile La Mancha, Asturias, Cantabria, Rioja, Navarre, Basque Country, Balearic Islands and Madrid.

**Agreements or conventions co-financed by the autonomous administrations and national organizations**

There are hundreds agreements or conventions co-financed by the autonomous administrations and national organizations. These agreements usually are collaborationand institutional between national, regional anl local organizations. Many of these agreements are reflected in the [National Cartographic System (SCN)](https://www.scne.es/). Another good example is agreements between environmental organisations and departments of [Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAPA)](https://www.mapa.gob.es/es/cartografia-y-sig/ide/) and [Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge (MITECO)](https://www.miteco.gob.es/es/cartografia-y-sig/ide.html).

### Costs and Benefits <a name="costs"></a>

**Costs:**

Some figures:
A study performed in 2019 has roughly evaluated the annual cost of the national node of Spanish SDI in 120,000 € and the social benefits provide society with publishing viewing services in 1 M €, of a published map tile using its API. An approximated not very accurate estimation of cost-benefits ratio gives a result of at least 1:8 which must be only considered as an idea of the order of magnitude.

**Benefits:**

[**Economic benefits of the SDI central node (CNIG and University of Leuven)**](https://www.idee.es/resources/documentos/CNIG-ES_Cost_Benefit_Central_SDI_Node_v018.pdf)
A study about the benefits and value of the Central SDI-node of Spain by KU Leuven and CNIG to develop and test a methodology for quantifying the benefits or value of the central SDI-node of Spain by comparing WMS/WMTS using figures with the fee-models applied by some Member
States (France, Finland and Sweden) and the feed-model applied by Google for its Google Maps API’s. Moreover, also the value of the geospatial datasets downloaded is quantified based on the fee-models applied in some of the Member States.
A calculator has been designed to enable organisations to calculate the benefit of publishing data through OGC services.

[**SDI of Aragon**](https://icearagon.aragon.es) has carried out a [report on the performance](https://www.aragon.es/documents/d/guest/informe_rendimiento_2023) of the Spatial Knowledge Infrastructure of Aragon (ICEARAGON) and the Active Geodesy Network of Aragon (AREAGA) that has led to a saving of almost two million euros for citizens in 2023.
- The [Geographic Institute of Aragon (IGEAR)](https://www.aragon.es/organismos/departamento-de-desarrollo-territorial-despoblacion-y-justicia/direccion-general-de-desarrollo-territorial/instituto-geografico-de-aragon-igear-) has been collecting statistics on the use of ICEARAGON and ARAGEA for three years with the aim of knowing the impact of its services and applications from an economic point of view. :
 - 4,842,830 visits to the website in 2023, an increase of 58.6% compared to 2022.
 - 47.8% of the information downloaded refers to environmental layers, 13.8% to administrative boundaries, 13.4% to maps of Aragon, 7% to energy or 4.7% to hunting grounds.
The actual turnover that IGEAR would have achieved if it charged for its network services or products would be:
- ICEARAGON service according to EU average 1.479.484,6+161.221= 1.640.705,6 € (52,9% increase compared to 2022).
- ICEARAGON Service according to Spain average 1.331.778,3+161.221= 1.492.999,3 € (increase of 52,3% compared to 2022).
And the total volume of costs saved for the company:
- ICEARAGON service according to EU average + ARAGEA = 1.992.665,60 euros/year.
- ICEARAGON service according to SPAIN + ARAGEA average = 1,844,959.30 euros/year.

**The Data Economy in the Infomediary field**
[ASEDIE](https://www.asedie.es/en/home), Multisectorial Information Association, brings together infomediary companies, which use, re-use and distribute information from different sectors, creating value-added products that contribute to greater security for global merchant traffic by boosting the economy through the application of methods that favor the reliability and transparency of commercial transactions in the business world. 
This report is based on 43 surveys of companies in the infomediary sector, which analyse and process information from the public and private sectors to create value-added products for third party companies or the general public. ASEDIE's annual report (2023)highlights has the following conclusions:
- 100% of companies use information from the national administrationa, 88% from the Autonomous Regions and 72% from regional administration and 72% of local entities.
- 77% of the companies state that with the opening of data in 2015, they are devoting more effort to working with geospatial information of [National Cartographic System (SCN)](https://www.scne.es/) products.
- 80% use aerial and satellite images, 67% use maps and topographic bases and 62% use LiDAR data. The average number of products used by companies is between 6 and 8.
- 16.3% of the companies state that more than 50% of their turnover depends on [National Cartographic System (SCN)](https://www.scne.es/) products.
Report is available [here.](https://www.ign.es/resources/cnig/Datos-geoespaciales-IGN-CNIG-ASEDIE.pdf)

**Other benefits** are:
- Encourage the reuitilisation of geospatial datasets through services.
- Saving costs for administrations, businesses and citizens.
- Identify where official geographic information can be located.
- Integrate official geographic information with wider public data infrastructures and external data sources.
- Adopt an open and collaborative methodology to design and improve digital public services.
- The Spanish SDI complies with the recommendations of the [European Interoperability Framework](https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/eif_en/).
